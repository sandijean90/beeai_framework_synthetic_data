Context:
Shopify's platform teams are revisiting observability to reduce alert fatigue while the
Growth org explores AI-driven merchandising. Attendees included VP Eng Platforms (Marina L.),
Security Architect (Sofia N.).

Current stack & pain points:
- Mixed cloud (GCP + AWS), Kubernetes,
Kafka, Prometheus, Grafana, homegrown alert rules. 
- Noisy alerts with low precision; teams mute
channels during oncall rotations. 
- Limited root-cause hints; SREs manually correlate metrics,
logs, and traces. 
- Security requires tighter access reviews and clearer data residency posture for
any ML features.

Proposed approach:
- Introduce ML anomaly scoring layer that consumes metrics and
key business KPIs (checkout success rate, add-to-cart, latency) with seasonality awareness and
automatic thresholding. 
- Provide guided triage: top contributing signals, recent deploy
correlation, blast-radius heuristics. 
- For merchandising, use the same telemetry backbone to
connect customer behavior to recommendation outcomes for closed-loop learning.

Data handling &
residency:
- Prefer region-bound processing (NA/EU), with per-tenant encryption and scoped service
accounts. 
- Option to deploy scoring service in Shopify VPC; export only aggregate features when
needed for cross-region benchmarking.

Success metrics:
- Reduce false-positive alerts by 50–70%
within 60 days; median MTTD ↓ by 30%; mean MTTR ↓ by 20%. 
- For personalization pilots: +0.4–0.8 pp
CTR uplift on long-tail SKUs; +3–6% AOV in targeted categories.

Risks & constraints:
- High traffic
spikes around seasonal events; models must adapt quickly. 
- Access control must integrate with
Shopify’s SSO and approval workflows.

Open questions:
- Which product areas are safe to start with
(e.g., Men’s Accessories)? 
- How will security review residency constraints for cross-region
benchmarking?

Next steps:
- Send SOC 2 summary and data-flow diagram; propose a 2-week discovery
for alert reduction; schedule ROI-focused demo.

Content:
Objective:
Estimate impact of ML-driven recommendations on click-through rate (CTR), conversion rate
(CVR), and average order value (AOV) for a phased rollout beginning with Men’s Accessories.
Baseline & data inputs:
- Baseline CTR: 2.1% on recommendation modules; CVR: 3.2% sitewide; AOV:
$78; traffic: 18M weekly impressions. 
- Data features: item embeddings (co-views, co-buys), user
affinities, seasonality, margin constraints, inventory health.

Intervention assumptions:
- Expected
CTR lift: +0.4–0.8 pp; CVR lift: +0.1–0.3 pp; AOV lift: +3–6% due to long-tail discovery and better
bundling. 
- Uplift concentrated in cold-start and long-tail SKUs; guardrails cap low-margin
exposure.

Experiment design:
- 50/50 geo or traffic split; sample size powered for 95% confidence
within 2 weeks. 
- Success metric hierarchy: revenue per session > AOV > CTR; include margin-
adjusted revenue.

Rollout plan:
- Phase 0 (2 weeks): offline replay + shadow scoring to validate
ranker stability. 
- Phase 1 (2–4 weeks): limited online A/B with real-time feedback; track novelty
vs. relevance. 
- Phase 2: progressive exposure to additional categories.

Risks & mitigations:
-
Cold-start for new items → hybrid ranker with business rules; 
- Inventory volatility →
availability-aware scoring; 
- Seasonal spikes → dynamic exploration rate caps.

Example back-of-
the-envelope:
If CTR increases by 0.6 pp on 18M impressions, that’s +108k clicks. With a 0.2 pp CVR
lift and AOV up 4%, estimated weekly incremental revenue ranges $280k–$520k (sensitivity attached).
Dependencies:
- Event stream (Kafka), catalog service, inventory API, consent management, security
sign-off on data flows.

- Ruggedized Linux gateway with OPC-UA
collector; local feature extraction (FFT peaks, kurtosis, crest factor). 
- Secure MQTT/AMQP uplink
to Azure IoT Hub; processing via Azure Functions + Data Explorer; long-term storage in ADLS Gen2;
dashboards in Power BI.

Modeling & alerting:
- Unsupervised anomaly detection (isolation
forest/autoencoder) with per-asset baselines; 
- Health score trendline and predicted time-to-
maintenance windows; 
- Alerts integrated with existing CMMS ticketing and planner workflows.
Security & compliance:
- Device identity, cert rotation, RBAC via Entra ID; audit trails on all
config changes; 
- Network segmentation, zero-trust connectivity, and customer-managed keys.

KPIs &
success criteria:
- 10–15% reduction in unexpected outages; 5–8% spare-part optimization; improved
planner efficiency measured by time-to-ticket close. 
- Pilot duration 12–16 weeks; success gates at
weeks 4, 8, and 12.

Title: Mini-case: Faster site startup via CTMS integration (Aug 15, 2025)
Created At: 2025-08-15T09:45:00Z
Author: Alex Chen
Conference ID: C2025-01
Tags: clinical-ops, ctms, case-study, site-startup, governance, lineage

Content:
Objective:
Demonstrate how tapping CTMS data can shorten site startup timelines by improving
feasibility, investigator selection, and activation sequencing.

Integration scope:
- Systems: CTMS
(investigator profiles, site readiness, visit schedules), eTMF (essential docs), feasibility
surveys, and contracting milestones. 
- Ingestion cadence: nightly for master data; hourly for
activation status; CDC for high-value tables.

Data model & features:
- Investigator availability,
historical enrollment velocity, protocol fit, competing study load, and regulatory turnaround SLAs.
- Predictive signals for sites at risk of delays (missing contracts, IRB lag, staff turnover).
Expected impact:
- Reduce site startup by 10–15 days across two Phase II trials by front-loading
contracting and targeting high-velocity sites. 
- Improve screen-to-randomization ratio via better
site selection and pre-activation checklists.

Workflow & governance:
- Role-based dashboards for
Clinical Ops; exception queues for at-risk sites; 
- Validated extracts for downstream analysis with
full lineage and e-sign approvals.

Risks & mitigations:
- Data quality variability across CRO
partners → automated checks and steward review; 
- Contracting bottlenecks → early flagging and
templated playbooks.

KPIs:
- Median days from site selection to SIV; % of sites activated on first
target date; data quality score; number of escalations avoided.
